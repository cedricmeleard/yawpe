# YAWPE

It's free to use, simply set your content, Yawpe will get rid of the rest for you

## Why Yawpe ?


YAWPE (pronouced Youhpi in French) stand for "Yet Another Web Presentation Engine",
allows you to create a simple web presentation.

When you want to share experiences or new things with other, you use many sort of medias,
but often, it's quite hard to make a great support, usable everywhere and easily by everyone.

 > evolution?
 
I'm still not really sure of what Yawpe will be, 2 options not incompatible,
* real time presentation, a user control navigation for other (tech firebase or socket.io)
* include an xAPI communication
 
## How to use Yawpe?

For now, yawpe use a json config file, it contains every sections and sub sections you need,
and graphical configuration 

first setup dependencies 

`npm install`

then you can use chrome (or a node server) to start index.html,
it will consume app/config/config.json file and inject content to app

there is another page, edit.html, it allows you to create a json like data 
to replace easily config.json.

> It is still in early development stage, 
> therefore it will not provide sub-section and may fail with markdown multi-lines

## What does Yawpe do ?

It can save you some time, and add a little 'plus' to your presentation,
a waouh effect :)

You are a developer, use it as a base, 
upgrade it, customize it, do what ever you want to make it as you wish 

You don't code, it will be fine soon with tools dedicated to.
